# opensea-clone
Clone of OpenSea. With a much worse UI, xD.

Working prototype on any of the following links:
- [https://www.opensea.io](opensea-clone-lovat.vercel.app)
- [https://www.opensea-MakC.io](opensea-clone-git-main-makc-ukr.vercel.app)
- [https://www.opensea-clone.io](opensea-clone-makc-ukr.vercel.app)

### Contract address:
0x890Ff017a63752a41D68BB81019761facaa06664

The UI in some places takes time to load (upto 5 seconds) so have patience.

To run:
1. Donwload and run npm install in react-app folder
2. "npm start" and go to localhost. Remember to connect your wallet and then reload the website.

Possible improvements: 
1. Faster DB management
2. Each NFT has its own page
3. Implement Search
